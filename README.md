# ðŸŽ“ Online Learning Platform â€“ PostgreSQL Backend Only

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project is a **SQL-only backend** for a simulated **online learning platform**, inspired by platforms like Udemy or Coursera.  
It is designed to model the full database layer â€” including users, courses, lessons, enrollments, reviews, payments, and reporting â€” using only **PostgreSQL**.

> This is a real-world, production-style relational schema built with serious intent: to showcase SQL skills from **beginner to advanced** levels.

---

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- **Database:** PostgreSQL 15+
- **Languages:** Pure SQL (DDL, DML, Views, Functions, Triggers, CTEs, Window Functions)
- **Tooling:** dbdiagram.io / drawSQL (for ERD)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project exists to:

- Build a complete, **scalable** database model using only SQL
- Demonstrate mastery of **relational data modeling**, **query optimization**, and **PostgreSQL-specific features**
- Simulate a complex, realistic use case that would exist in a **production-grade SaaS application**
- Provide a **portfolio-worthy** project for developers, database engineers, or backend-focused full-stack developers
